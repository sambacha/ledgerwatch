                First of all, I would like to extend my gratitude to Ethereum
                Foundation and the Scalability Fund for awarding Turbo-Geth
                project a very generous grant of $25&#39;000. This will
                definitely prove immensely helpful in the developement and
                testing (I am using Cloud machines for testing now and the bills
                are getting quite high). And this is not just about money, I
                really appreciate the recognition of my efforts.
              </p>
              <p name="a358" id="a358" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                This grant makes me want to work harder on Turbo-Geth. And this
                is a good moment to update you all on my progress.

                >, I have managed to implement the idea of the “hash file”,
                which is a memory-mapped file always with the size of 32Mb, kept
                alongside the “chaindata” database file. It stores hashes of all
                nodes on the level 5 of the accounts trie (there are maximum 16⁵
                of them, because the trie is hexary). Updates to the file are
                coincided with the committing to the “chaindata” database file.
              </p>
              <p name="9090" id="9090" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Each time Turbo-Geth starts, it tries to rebuild the top of the
                accounts trie (levels from 0 to 5) from the hashfile. This
                process takes about 0,5 seconds normally. If it does not
                succeed, however (because hashfile is missing or corrupted, or
                incorrect — meaning that the restored root hash does not match
                what is expected), hashfile is reconstructed from the
                “chaindata” database, which currently takes about 1,5 hours for
                the block 5m on a cold machine.
              </p>
              <p name="abb4" id="abb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Introduction of the hashfile not only solves the problem of the
                slow startup, but also allows running a Turbo-Geth node on a
                machine with a very modest amount of memory. Previous version
                required tens of Gb of memory to rebuild account trie from
                “chain data”, but rebuilding the hashfile has a constant memory
                footprint in the range of 100Mb.

                Another thing that I have completed is the rebase to the latest
                (as of 7th of March) master of go-ethereum, to get all the fixes
                and improvements in, and also to be able to upgrade to go 1.10.
                Number of conflicts around trie management code is large, and
                now I am working through the broken tests again. Lots of tests
                simply do not apply anymore (for example, state trie sync won’t
                work for Turbo-Geth, because it does not materialise state trie
                as such). Also, it does not use intermediate trie cache
                database, introduced in geth 1.8. I am most excited about
                testing the RPC API requests before running another performance
                benchmark on the cloud.
