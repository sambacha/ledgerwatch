This will definitely prove immensely helpful in the developement and testing (I am using Cloud machines for testing now and the bills are getting quite high). And this is not just about money, I really appreciate the recognition of my efforts.</p><p name="a358" id="a358" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This grant makes me want to work harder on Turbo-Geth. And this is a good moment to update you all on my progress.</p><p name="31be" id="31be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since my <a href="https://medium.com/@akhounov/more-on-ethereum-accounts-trie-structure-8383a9fd4c93" data-href="https://medium.com/@akhounov/more-on-ethereum-accounts-trie-structure-8383a9fd4c93" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">last post</a>, I have managed to implement the idea of the “hash file”, which is a memory-mapped file always with the size of 32Mb, kept alongside the “chaindata” database file. It stores hashes of all nodes on the level 5 of the accounts trie (there are maximum 16⁵ of them, because the trie is hexary). Updates to the file are coincided with the committing to the “chaindata” database file.</p><p name="9090" id="9090" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each time Turbo-Geth starts, it tries to rebuild the top of the accounts trie (levels from 0 to 5) from the hashfile. This process takes about 0,5 seconds normally. If it does not succeed, however (because hashfile is missing or corrupted, or incorrect — meaning that the restored root hash does not match what is expected), hashfile is reconstructed from the “chaindata” database, which currently takes about 1,5 hours for the block 5m on a cold machine.</p><p name="abb4" id="abb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Introduction of the hashfile not only solves the problem of the slow startup, but also allows running a Turbo-Geth node on a machine with a very modest amount of memory. Previous version required tens of Gb of memory to rebuild account trie from “chain data”, but rebuilding the hashfile has a constant memory footprint in the range of 100Mb.</p><p name="c5a0" id="c5a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Another thing that I have completed is the rebase to the latest (as of 7th of March) master of go-ethereum, to get all the fixes and improvements in, and also to be able to upgrade to go 1.10. Number of conflicts around trie management code is large, and now I am working through the broken tests again. Lots of tests simply do not apply anymore (for example, state trie sync won’t work for Turbo-Geth, because it does not materialise state trie as such). Also, it does not use intermediate trie cache database, introduced in geth 1.8. I am most excited about testing the RPC API requests before running another performance benchmark on the cloud.</p></div></div></section>
