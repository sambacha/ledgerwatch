                Ripple is not necessarily run by banks. It just turned out that
                the concept of assets in Ripple (IOUs for various fiat
                currencies) very accurately represents what bank money really
                is. Originally (Ripple was around before Bitcoin) the idea was
                that anyone would be able to run a Ripple gateway and issue IOUs
                (by accepting people’s deposits and processing withdrawals in
                exchange for those IOUs). But due to problems with reversed fiat
                transactions and various regulations, it turned out that the
                existing banks are actually the perfect gateways.

                What is the function of XRP?
              </h3>
              <p name="5cc5" id="5cc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                My understanding is that XRP (native currency of Ripple) has 2
                functions in such system:
              </p>
              <ol class="postList">
                <li name="ea65" id="ea65" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
                  A small amount of it is required to create IOUs (to prevent
                  spamming)
                </li>
                <li name="0693" id="0693" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
                  It can play a role of intermediate asset if there is no direct
                  market between IOUs. For example, if there is Citi USD IOUs
                  and Chase USD IOUs, and there is no direct swap, you might be
                  able to swap one for XRP and then XRP for another
                </li>

                Consensus mechanism centralised?
              </h3>
              <p name="c617" id="c617" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                People often criticise Ripple’s consensus mechanism. When you
                set up a node (I tried to do that back in 2014, but gave up
                after 2 weeks of trying, though I got Bitcoin and Ethereum POC
                going in no time), you specify the list of nodes that you
                “trust” (or just take the default which contains bunch of
                sX.ripple.com servers), and then you definition of finality of
                certain transaction depends on your list of “trusted” servers.
                If your list is too non-standard, you might see different
                picture of finality from others. Therefore, most people simply
                use the default, because it is a “Shelling point”
              </p>

                Is it good or bad?
              </h3>
              <p name="56f4" id="56f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                I think adoption of Ripple allows banks (and their customers) to
                better deal with bank money (IOUs) especially in an event of a
                credit crisis, where value of various IOUs diverge between each
                other and from the high-powered money (cash and central bank
                money). Traditionally, accounting systems in banks (and other
                enterprises) simply assume that “money is money”, leaving out
                the nuances that most money is actually someone’s liability. If
                you start using Ripple to improve your accounting, it is less
                likely you will be sending money into a “black hole” (bankrupted
                counter-party), as it happened to many in the first days after
                Lehman filed for bankruptcy.

                Competition?
              </h3>
              <p
                name="e5d2"
                id="e5d2"

              >
                And I also think that Ripple is not a competition for Bitcoin or
                Ethereum, or any other public cryptocurrencies. Ripple is a
                platform for IOU management. It can also have IOUs for Ethereum
                and Bitcoin, if you will. But Bitcoin and Ethereum, if they stay
                de-centralised, will still be like high-powered money in
                relation to those IOUs. The synergy is possible.
