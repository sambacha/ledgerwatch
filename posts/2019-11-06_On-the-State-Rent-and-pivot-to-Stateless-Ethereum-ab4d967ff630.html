                After publishing it, I started to think about how one could
                realistically deliver such a project. And, very early on, it has
                been identified that one would definitely need something I call
                “ecosystem research”. What is it?
              </p>
              <p name="29dc" id="29dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                We knew from the very beginning of the State research (from the
                very first proposal, published in November 2018) that
                introduction of the proportional state rent on the contract
                storage (“proportional” meaning that contract gets charged rent
                proportionally to how many storage items it uses), would make
                most of the currently existing smart contracts vulnerable to “
                griefing” attacks, whereby someone can at a small fixed cost
                make contract pay some amount of rent in perpetuity, eventually
                leading to the demise of that contract.
              </p>
              <p name="46d9" id="46d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                We also had a hypothesis that most or even all Dapps could be
                re-written in such way that makes them non-vulnerable to such
                attacks. Notable example is a version of ERC-20 token
                implementation
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ledgerwatch/eth_state/tree/master/erc20"
                  data-href="https://github.com/ledgerwatch/eth_state/tree/master/erc20"

                  target="_blank"
                  >here</a
                >. Although it was a good start (my estimates at the time showed
                that about half of all contract storage was taken by the
                balances and allowances of various ERC-20 contracts), the tail
                of the Dapps may be quite long.
              </p>
              <p name="1e05" id="1e05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                It would be the task of the “ecosystem research” to meticulously
                analyse that tail of the Dapps, re-write them into
                non-vulnerable form, and engage with the maintainers and users
                of such Dapps to prepare for the change. It became clear that
                without such “ecosystem research”, the migration to the State
                rent regime was very unlikely to succeed.
              </p>
              <p name="c5c0" id="c5c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                However, it was not hard to estimate that this “ecosystem
                research” is a very daunting and expensive (perhaps a few
                million dollars) task. I certainly was not willing to embark on
                it myself, mostly because I did not think (and I still don’t)
                that this was where I would add the most value and gain
                satisfaction from my work. And since, de-facto, I was the only
                person researching State rent full time to the best of my
                knowledge, my conclusion that this will not be done, and we need
                a different plan.
              </p>
              <p name="de77" id="de77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Therefore, I returned to the idea that we “brushed off”
                (overlooked?) before embarking on the State rent project, namely
                “Stateless Clients”, or as I call it now, “Stateless Ethereum”.
                I first got interested in this back at the end of 2017 (scroll
                to the end of

                >), and then started on the Turbo-Geth project. The initial
                scepticism was based on the fact that the block witnesses would
                be quite large. But now that we are returning to this, we are
                asking “how large?”, and “can we make them smaller?”. And this
                is roughly where I started to get some
                <a

              <p name="fb55" id="fb55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                We also knew that most probably (more data on this will be
                coming soon), hexary tree that we have in Ethereum make block
                witnesses larger than a binary tree would. But it appeared an
                impossible task to switch Ethereum 1 to binary trees. And again,
                if you think “why?”, the answer is that is based on the
                assumption that we will be keeping the current way of storing
                the state in the database (namely modelling data as a directed
                graph with edges from hashes to the trie nodes). However, if we
                change to the model that Turbo-Geth uses, the switching over to
                binary tree becomes quite straightforward. That is why one of my
                highest priorities at this moment is to “finish” Turbo-Geth,
                i.e. to solve all the edge cases and to provide enough evidence
                that its data model works, and it can be adopted by other
                implementations.

                To recap, the State Rent project is currently “suspended”. And
                the active research, development and specification is happening
                around “flat db” state storage model and the Stateless Ethereum.
                There are some advancements that happened since my last blog
                post in March, and I hope to get some more data and publish it
                soon. So far you can look at

                that is currently used to construct block witnesses, and watch
                the progress of Turbo-Geth, as it is hopefully nearing the
                “stable” stage (we are still changing a lot of things in the
                database format, so until this is settled, it is not “stable”):
