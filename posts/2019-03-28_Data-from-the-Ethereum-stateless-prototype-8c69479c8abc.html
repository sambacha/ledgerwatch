                fork. But I am still glad that I was finally able to collect

                Execution of transactions in a block requires transaction data
                (blue rectangles) and the current state (yellow rectangle).
                After the execution, the current state becomes a historical
                state, and the new current state is created. There are some
                other bits of data that transactions might require (like block
                timestamp, or one of the 256 previous block hashes), but we
                won’t look at them because they are constant in size and
                insignificant. Execution can also produce receipts (green
                stacks), but they are not important in the context of stateless
                clients.

                The main idea of stateless clients is to remove the requirement
                of access to the entire state when executing transaction in the
                block. The creator of the block supplements the block with a
                separate data structure, containing all the extracts from the
                state that are necessary to execute all the transactions in the
                block. In order for the executor to be sure that those extracts
                were indeed taken from the current state, the Merkle proofs are
                also supplied. This is possible because every block header
                carries so called “state root”, which is the root of the Merkle
                tree encompassing all the values in the state that existed after
                the block’s execution. This would lead to possibility of this
                kind of execution:

                It is important to note that the supplemental information (let’s
                call it Block Proofs) is also very useful for the stateful
                clients (those that want to keep the entire state and possibly
                history). Currently, the so-called “full nodes” execute blocks
                against their copy of the state and then verify that the Merkle
                root of the state tree that they computed matched the one in the
                block’s header. The computation of that Merkle tree root is a
                resource intensive operation, and requires either large memory
                or lots of I/O, as described

                for the full nodes to verify the correctness of the execution
                very easily, most likely without any I/O at all, and then simply
                update its current and historical state databases based on the
                execution results. They don’t need to have a cache of the state
                trie in memory, and their interaction with the state and state
                history database becomes predominantly write-only. It is
                illustrated here:

                Now to the biggest downside of the stateless client — the

                It took a while to make it all work, but I wanted the data to be
                pretty accurate. As I expected, there were a lot of edge cases
                to handle (because the hexary Merkle Patricia trie has things
                like leaf keys, extensions, embedded nodes). There are still
                some edge cases what make my prototype fail (currently on the
                blocks 5340939, 5361803, 5480357, 5480507, 5480722, 5632299,
                5707052, 5769636 and more…). But given that it only affects tens
                of blocks out of 6.7 million, I am confident that it will not
                distort the data enough to alter the analysis (of course, I will
                debug and fix those edge cases).

                large block proofs, which was done back in autumn of 2016. Lets

                The “tower” right after the Spurious Dragon hard fork is from
                the “state clearing”, where lots of accounts with zero balance

                state. That level of “block proof” intensity has seen been

                One of the ideas I wanted to test with this analysis is whether
                it is possible to use the stateless clients approach to avoid
                some parts of the rent. The most challenging part is the rent
                for contract storage, which makes lots of existing contracts
                vulnerable to griefing attacks. In the

                >
                there is a concept of the rent pre-payment, which is aimed to
                temporarily protect contracts from such griefing, and to allow
                some limited time to migrate to a new non-vulnerable code.

                The idea of using stateless client approach, at least for the
                contract storage part (therefore the breakdown above), is an
                attempt to instead create a permanent, albeit costly protection
                against griefing.

                It is inevitable, that if some form of stateless client
                mechanism is introduced, the transaction senders will need to
                pay extra gas proportional to the size of the block proof their
                transactions are generating. That would make operations with the
                contract storage (SLOAD, SSTORE) potentially much more costly
                than now. Incidentally,

                It is possible to apply stateless clients model to the existing
                contracts, and make the new contract opt-in to the contract
                storage with rent, which I expect would be much cheaper to use
                than the the one with the “block proofs”, but it will have a
                weird property of being able to disappear. This effectively
                means that we do not force the migration of the existing
                contract to the rent-compatible implementations within certain
                timeframe, but instead, incentivising them to migrate.

                Obviously, extend the data collection to the more recent blocks,
                and fix the existing edge cases.

                The size of the block proof is a big concern, even if we take
                contract storage component. I see two potential ways to bringing
                it down:

                  Introducing a bit more “statefullness” into the stateless
                  clients. What if the most of the clients are keeping N last
                  block proofs (N could be 1, 2, 3…). Then, if you (as in an
                  Ethereum node) know that your peer keeps that many past block
                  proofs, you may choose only to send the part of the block
                  proof that is not contained in those N recent ones. Your peer
                  will be able to reconstruct the full block proof on its own.
                  There needs to be more analysis on how beneficial this
                  strategy is.

                  Use of STARK proofs to compress the now variable “hashes” part
                  of the block proof to a proof of the constant size (the “state
                  of the art” STARKs have the proof size of around 60k as far as
                  I know). This would require more research and development
                  though, like creation of STARK circuits for Keccak256, for
                  example, seeing how much overhead the prover will have, would
                  we need a GPU to accelerate the prover, to seal the block
                  quickly enough…
