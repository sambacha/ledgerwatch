                I have been delaying writing this opinion piece to avoid the
                distraction. I have just come back from the Stanford Blockchain
                conference. It was the first time I have attended a blockchain
                conference which is not specific to Ethereum (in the past I only
                attended Devcon, Edcon, and DappCon), and it is there that I got
                some insights that I was missing earlier. If you read (or just
                scroll) to the end, you will see what finally triggered me to
                write this. I reserve the right to change my opinions, and urge
                others not just take my word for it — use this only as a
                guidance and do your own research.

                I will structure this opinion piece as a series of four claims.
                Any of them could be subjective or untrue, but I currently

                Both of these action lead to the reduction of mining revenue.

                Some people claim that the reason that the reason EtHash
                specialised mining devices appeared only recently (3+ years
                after the launch of Ethereum) is due to EtHash’s excellent
                “ASIC-resistance”, compared to other algorithms. I believe that
                instead this 3 years delay is mostly due to:

                It appears to me that the growing consensus among blockchain
                developers is that it is counterproductive to fight the
                specialisation of mining hardware. The goal instead should be
                indirectly fostering (or at least not resisting) more
                competition in the mining hardware development, which can be
                achieved by keeping mining “rewarding”. This can be done either
                by increasing the rewards, or by decreasing the mining costs.
                Both EIP-1234 (reduction of reward) and ProgPOW (increase of
                mining cost) go into the opposite direction.

                If we look at a very helpful table of how much miners earn per

                Litecoin, ZCash, Bitcoin Cash are predominantly mined with
                specialised (not GPUs) hardware, it becomes clear that Ethereum
                is “the last bastion” of GPU mining.

                I do not anticipate any new cryptocurrencies launching with the
                aspiration of being “ASIC-resistant”. Notable example is Grin,
                which will increase the reward share of their ASIC-friendly
                algorithm from 10% to 100% within the first 2 years after
                launch. Decision of Grin to actually make one of the algorithms
                ASIC-friendly is due to their hope that making ASIC design
                simpler will encourage competition. Here is the relevant

                One of the most interesting takeways from David Vorick’s talk

                separate from “taping out”, which is in turn separate from the
                actual fabrication. Another interesting fact about people like
                David is that it does not take a very long time (1–2 years) for
                a very good software developer to learn enough about hardware
                design to set up a design shop. The required information to do
                such a transition is not well shared and accessible, so one has
                to learn directly from people, but such transition is not at all
                impossible. Hardware design is not a black magic and I expect,
                given the demand, the number of independent hardware design
                shops will only grow.

                There were some calls to the Ethereum protocol developers to
                come up with the “Guidelines for the developers of the
                specialised mining hardware for ProgPOW on Ethereum”. At first,
                I did not really understand what these guidelines would be. But
                recently someone has explained to me that it would be basically
                answer to the question: “Hey, Ethereum protocol developers, we
                heard you are switching PoW to ProgPoW. We want to start
                designing a specialised hardware for it (yes, we know that you
                think we shouldn’t, but it is neither illegal nor unethical to
                do it, so we will give it a shot). Please tell us what we should
                do to make sure we are not labeled as bad actors after the
                fact”.

                This is a very reasonable question. But if you subscribe to the
                ASIC-resistance strategy, the only answer you can give is this:
                “There is nothing you can do to prevent being labeled as a bad
                actor. We don’t want you to develop your hardware, and if we see
                that you have succeeded, we will try to do another PoW change so
                you cannot sell your hardware and go out of business”. Which is
                not a very reasonable answer, and can hurt more than help.
