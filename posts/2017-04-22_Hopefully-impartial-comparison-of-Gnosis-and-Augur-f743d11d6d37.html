                I have been recently researching Gnosis ahead of the announced
                auction on the 24th of April. One of the frequent questions that
                people ask is “How does Gnosis compare to Augur”? I have not
                found a good impartial comparison, therefore I am writing this.

                Both platforms support 3 types of events: Binary (outcomes are
                YES and NO), Categorical (there are multiple discrete outcomes,
                for example, winning candidate in an election), and Scalar
                (there is a Lower and Upper boundary defined for such an event).

                In the current implementation, Augur allows ETH to be used as
                collateral tokens, and Gnosis lets one specify the collateral
                token as a parameter when a market is created. Note that these
                two operations can be performed at any time, regardless of any
                oracles or prices at the market. Currently, Augur does not
                charge a fee for such operation (though gas cost needs to be
                paid), and Gnosis currently charges zero fees, but the plan is
                (deducted from the code) to charge fees in WIZ proportional to
                number of shares bought or sold.

                Market resolves through decision of the corresponding oracle.
                Currently, both platforms let one specify the oracle (as a smart
                contract of certain form) for so-called “fast resolution”. Also,
                both platforms have backstops, for the case if someone disagrees
                with the result of the fast resolution. Backstops will be
                described later.

                It is pretty trivial to imagine that in Binary and Categorical
                markets, winning outcomes can be redeemed for 1 unit of
                collateral tokens, and losing outcomes become worthless. In
                Scalar (or Ranged in Gnosis terminology) markets, the payoffs

                In Augur, the ownership of outcome shares is currently recorded
                in the data structures of the smart contracts, and transfers are
                tightly controlled by the trading functions. This allows Augur
                to collect fees whenever the shares are traded (i.e. amount of
                fees is proportional to the trading volume). Fees are currently
                collected in ETH, and are specified as a parameter when a market
                is created (default suggested values are 1% for makers and 2%
                for takes). These fees are split 50/50 between the creator of
                the market and the REP holders who happen to participate in the
                resolution.

                In Gnosis, on the other hand, the outcome shares can be
                “detached” in the form of ERC-20 tokens, and traded elsewhere
                (however it is still possible to trade them directly on Gnosis).
                This allows for liquidity to be moved around and aggregated in
                various unpredictable and interesting ways, but makes it
                hard/impossible for Gnosis to collect trading fees.

                Creator of a market can make their market more attractive by
                adding initial liqudity. Initial liquidity is given in
                collateral tokens and is used to buy some complete sets of
                outcome shares. In Augur, these shares are then placed in the
                order books around what the creator believes is the current fair
                price. In Gnosis, the creator attaches a market-maker contract.
                That market maker automatically determines the price at which an
                outcome share can be bought from or sold to the creator of the
                market. Currently, one of the sample market makers provided on
                the github is LMSR market maker.

                if this is indeed possible.

                From technological point of view, the projects are very similar
                and have converged on lots of similar ideas. This is
                understandable — both teams spent considerable amount of time
                and effort developing their platforms on Ethereum, bumped into a
                lot of constraints, and a lot of common solutions seem
                “inevitable”.
              </p>
              <p name="a006" id="a006" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Economic models are different. In Augur, the outcome shares do
                not currently leave the marketplace, and it allows Augur to
                charge fees proportional to the trading volume, and channel them
                to the REP holders who report. In Gnosis, the fees collected are
                proportional to the outstanding shares (charged at the point of
                buying or selling of complete sets, as well as taking liquidity
                from the market maker). It is impossible to say which model will
                become more lucrative for REP and GNO holders respectively. It
                might be that higher liquidity elsewhere will cause Gnosis
                outcome shares to be produced in great numbers, or conditional
                markets become very popular.

                In my opinion, the Oracle backstop used in Augur looks more
                plausible. It has some features of Proof Of Stake, with similar
                notion of selection weight, slashing, and subjectivity (via REP
                forks). It might be possible, however, for Gnosis to use the
                Augur Oracle backstop as a plugin.
