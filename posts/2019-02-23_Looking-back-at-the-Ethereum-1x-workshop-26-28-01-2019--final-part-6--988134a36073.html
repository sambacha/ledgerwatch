                On the diagram above, we see main data transformations that
                happen during the block executions in Ethereum. Usually, the
                transactions taken from the block bodies are executed in the
                context of the state, and that results in the new, modified
                state, and also generates receipts (those receipts contain
                logs). This has correspondence in the yellow paper too, the
                relevant extract is shown at the end of this section.

                Chain pruning is not about the “current state” (this is subject
                of previous parts) and “historical states” (this is currently
                pruned or written only sparsely already), but about block
                headers, block bodies (with transactions in them), and receipts
                (with event logs in them). Péter Szilágyi has written the first
                chain pruning document back in November 2018, which is

                on the topic, where he highlighted that a better understanding
                of the actual requirements and possible tradeoffs is needed.

                Depending on what an Ethereum node is used for, it may have
                different requirements to what data needs to be kept around and
                for how long. If the required data are missing, there are some
                operatives in the eth/63 protocol to fetch them from the peers:

                However, and this has also been noted in Frederik’s
                presentation, if peers made very diverse decisions about what
                data to keep around and for how long, it might take a while to
                find a peer that has just the information you are missing. The
                hope is in the new discovery protocols, like “Discovery 5”,
                which has been in development for few years. Regarding
                discovery, Antoine Toulme has made an impromptu presentation and
                explained some of the challenges. For example, if discovery
                allows you to be very “picky” about your peers, there is a risk
                of creating “islands” in the network, around the peers that
                possess certain rare information.

                As discussed in the part 4 of this series, increased use of
                Stateless Contract pattern would lead to the increased size of
                transactions, and therefore, accelerated growth of the “block
                bodies” component of the chain.

                Ethereum protocol changes do not need to take a year to
                be prepared
              </h3>
              <p name="f15d" id="f15d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                We had a brief retrospective on why the changes in the latest
                Ethereum upgrades, Byzantium and Constantinople, seemingly took
                a long time to prepare. Since we did not have a lot of core
                developers present, this retrospective definitely lacked some
                useful perspective, but I will put out here what came out of it.
                A lot of what is written below is my personal perspective too.
              </p>

                One apparent reason for “low change bandwidth” is the fact that
                there was no reason to rush. Once changes were specified and
                decision was made to include them, implementation of the entire
                Constantinople took probably couple of weeks, no more. Everyone
                knew approximately when the difficulty bomb would start slowing
                the blocks down. Other changes that were planned did not have
                certain deadline and there were not strictly speaking essential,
                more like “nice to haves”.
              </p>

                In Byzantium, a lot of time and effort was spent on precompiles.
                Fuzz tests found lots of bugs.
              </p>
              <p name="707a" id="707a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Third apparent reason was the fact that review of the changes
                happened very slowly. A lot of times people present on the Core
                Dev Calls were not prepared to discuss the proposed changes, so
                discussion had to be postponed (each time for 2 more weeks).

                So what can be done to increase the “bandwidth” for Ethereum 1.x
                changes? Here are my ideas (would be curious to read more of
                them):
              </p>
              <ol class="postList">
                <li name="f969" id="f969" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
                  Only essential changes (those that need to be done ASAP based
                  on reasonable projections, or those being on the critical path
                  to the former) are to be proposed.
                </li>
                <li name="a9bb" id="a9bb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
                  Specific precompiles are to be handled generically within the
                  eWASM working group (meta-features vs point-features).
                </li>
                <li
                  name="9842"
                  id="9842"

                  Even if we continue to use Core Dev Calls as a change review
                  venue, most discussions should happen prior to the call. To
                  make it work better, for each change, we should appoint a
                  reviewer (or couple) who will either review changes
                  themselves, or prod other reviewers to do so. It is a good
                  idea to start growing the number of change reviewers, even
                  from the people who are not necessarily on the calls
                  currently, but can be invited.
