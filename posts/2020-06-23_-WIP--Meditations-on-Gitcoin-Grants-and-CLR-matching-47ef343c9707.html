                No, I did not actually do meditations on it. I am just stealing
                part of the title from the “Meditations on Moloch”
                (unfortunately, the blog where it was published has been taken
                down literally a day ago, but you may be able to find some
                copies if you want). And no, I do not want to compare Gitcoin
                Grants with Moloch either, though that would be cool.

                Assumptions and Purpose
              </h3>
              <p name="e85f" id="e85f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                Firstly, I need to keep reminding myself that Gitcoin project
                did not start with grants. It started as a platform to assign
                bounties for work on open-source projects. I do not have any
                stats on how well this has been going. But at some point,
                Gitcoin Grants project appeared, and I can understand the
                rationale — many projects cannot or do not want to run their
                work flows via Gitcoin model — for example, it would not work
                for my project. Therefore, why not give funds directly to the
                projects without “micromanaging” their workflow?
              </p>
              <p name="04db" id="04db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Here is my reading of initial assumptions and purpose of Gitcoin
                Grants. It is assumed that there is a non-trival number of
                people or organisations possessing some amount of cryptocurrency
                (or other things that can be used to acquite cryptocurrency),
                who would like to donate (not invest) some amount to
                individuals, projects, and team working on Ethereum-related
                things (perhaps it is broader, I don’t know). Second assumption
                is that the total amount that can be donated is non-trivial
                either. Third assumption is that these people and organisations
                do not donate because they either do not know how, or they do
                not know who they should donate to.
              </p>
              <p name="c1ea" id="c1ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Therefore, my reading of the purpose of Gitcoin Grants is to
                help donors donate by giving then a nice User Interface with a
                catalog of projects and by processing their donation payments.
                With the addition of CLR matching, the purpose has been
                augmented to also help select donors to distribute donations
                automatically, via a quadratic matching algorithm
              </p>
              <h3 name="b6fa" id="b6fa" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">
                My anecdotal observations
              </h3>
              <p name="b605" id="b605" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                I will not present any data to back my observations (though some
                data may exist to back them or to prove them wrong), therefore I
                will call them anecdotal. I did not want to turn this into a big
                project, so please treat it more as an entertainment and food
                for thought rather than as a solid analysis.
              </p>
              <p name="a2fb" id="a2fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                First observation is the donation activity on Gitcoin Grants was
                relatively low until the first CLR matching round was
                introduced. Each successive round brought larger amounts in the
                CLR pot, and also saw larger amount of donations than previous
                round.
              </p>
              <p name="8181" id="8181" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Before I joined my project to the CLR Round 4, and before I
                myself tried donating a bit, I did not understand mechanics of
                Gitcoin Grants or CLR very well. When I did join, I noticed that
                the donated DAI appears on the wallets immediately, which was
                slightly surprising at first. The reason it was surprising was
                the idea of re-donating and re-cycling of the same DAI, which
                probably happens a fair bit, because we are still a very close
                circle of people donating to each other. I do not know if there
                are some algorithms that discount such recycling when producing
                donation statistics and/or CLR matching amounts, but it would be
                interesting to see how big it is. And if such tracing algorithms
                did exist, then they could probably be easily fooled with
                privacy tools like Tornado Cash.
              </p>
              <p name="c34f" id="c34f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                So the second observation that followed from the first is that
                it seemed that CLR matching rounds were introduced regularly to
                keep the donation activity going. In fact, a higher order
                observation can be made that the common knowledge that CLR
                matching rounds will be conducted regularly, has effectively
                destroyed any donation activity between the rounds. It is now
                quite rational to never donate between the rounds, because
                rounds are happening frequently enough and they bring a
                non-negative top-up to your donations (or even potential avenue
                for some easy money via sybil manipulation and donation
                recycling).
              </p>
              <p name="1917" id="1917" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Another surprising thing was the actual deployment of quadratic
                funding. I understand that the root of this idea is in the
                quadratic voting, where it is assumed that somehow all the
                voters are identified and sybil attacks are hard to mount. I am
                aware that Gitcoin Grants team was hard at work to combat sybil
                attacks by various techniques, like SMS messaging. But I am
                still sceptical of the scalability of any of these approaches. I
                think the vulnerability to sybil attack is a blocker for
                deployment of quadratic funding in crypto-currency settings.

                Collective intelligence at scale
              </h3>
              <p name="b235" id="b235" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                So far Gitcoin Grants ecosystem has been pretty exciting and
                showed great growth (mostly due to regular CLR injections). But
                I have some doubts that in its current form it can be effective
                at a large scale, when number of projects to fund, number of
                donors, and the amounts given (which will need to be propped up
                by a corresponding increase in CLR funding) grows 1 or 2 orders
                of magnitude. At that point, the large funder putting their
                money into CLR matching rounds would ask the question: “Why is
                this better than running our own grants program?”. The answer
                they would be looking for is this: “Because the Gitcoin Grants
                system will automatically figure out, by the use of clever
                quadratic funding math, who are the worthy recipients of our
                funds, so we do not need to”. Except that the clever math won’t
                do it. I will present it as a “theorem without proof”, but my
                intuition is that a collective of 100 thousand individual donors
                donating to 10 thousand projects will not have a very large
                collective intelligence, in fact it will probably make very dumb
                decisions, allocating most money to people they already know.
                And quadratic funding will blindly amplify these decision, at
                the same time being slightly (or not so slightly) corrupted by
                the ongoing arms race between sybils and the anti-sybil
                mechanisms.
              </p>
              <p name="7aaf" id="7aaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                What we need is a system that grows its collective intelligence
                at scale, instead of becoming dumber and stiffer.

                Idea of a solution
              </h3>
              <p name="4dca" id="4dca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                I have not designed this system, because I only had a few hours
                thinking done on this. First of all, the quadratic funding
                element needs to be scrapped. It gives the system rivalrous
                character that it did not have before. It introduces weird
                exclusionary mechanisms that are part of the sybil/anti-sybil
                arms race. And it effectively kills all non-quadratic funding
                activity.

                The main crux is to try to replace an equation with human
                intelligence, via introduction of intermediaries. Yes,
                intermediaries. I know some of you may have an allergic reaction
                to the word. But hold on. Not all intermediaries are bad, only
                those who extract rent without adding value. There are lots of
                useful intermediaries. Funding intermediaries in an improved
                system will take on the work of researching the projects,
                potentially talking to the founders, and directing funds to the
                ones that they found really useful. Intermediaries do not need
                to be identified as persons and can become pseudonymous, as long
                as their funding activity is transparent. To prevent them from
                running away with the money, the “flow” dynamics can be
                introduced, whereby not all the funds are released in one go,
                but with small instalments, so that the donors can get an alarm
                if an intermediary made some strange moves and suspend further
                funding if required. Effectively, intermediaries would always
                have a cap of how much money they hold, and it is up to them how
                efficient they are at redistributing.

                Over time, as the group of established funding intermediaries
                emerges, we would have effectively created an “opt-in”
                institution consisting of specialists in finding relevant
                projects and allocating funding to them. Donors are not bound to
                a specific set of intermediaries and can always switch,
                therefore I call them “opt-in” institution.

              <p name="e5b4" id="e5b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                My intuition is that the collective intelligence of such
                institution would be higher than that of quadratic formula over
                individual point-to-point donations. Point-to-point donations
                are mostly driven by some personal knowledge and advertising.
                Specialist donations can be driven by proper research and
                governance.

                I think it was right for Gitcoin Grants to pivot, but I do not

                another pivot needs to be done.
