                Google announced TPU (Tensor Processor Unit) in 2016, which is
                currently the most famous example of DSA (Domain Specific
                Architecture). For machine learning, TPUs were announced to be
                10x faster than completion, and it is now used by billions of
                people. It also sparked a lot of interest in DSA and tons of
                activity like creations of startups and acquisitions. Clock
                speed is lower than CPUs or GPUs, matrix multiply units use
                systolic architecture, there are no hierarchical memory caches,
                it has more on-chip memory than GPUs. Performance per watt is
                83x better than CPU, and 29x better than GPU.

                Couple of things I did not appreciate until I read the article

                  There can be multiple stages of design (FPGA, ASIC flow,
                  Tape-in), before “tape-out” (which is the stage where you
                  supposedly fork out a few millions of dollars and wait for
                  couple of months to get your masks back).
                </li>
                <li name="adf9" id="adf9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
                  The crucial thing about Tape-in is that you can get very
                  accurate estimates about the performance of your chip and its
                  power consumption, before you go ahead and spend millions on
                  tape out.

                  You can rent FPGAs on AWS to tests things out before moving
                  the the ASIC flow.

                All these things reduce the cost (and will continue to reduce it
                even further) for hardware design.

                  Answering one of the questions, David says that for TSMC (one
                  the foundries, companies that perform Tape-Out of chips), the
                  cost of 7nm transistor is the same as the cost of 28nm
                  transistor, meaning that the cost of transistor does not go
                  down anymore when you make transistors smaller and smaller. So
                  the benefits of making smaller and smaller transistors will
                  stop very soon, and this is already happening. This would lead
                  to a more competitive ecosystem of foundries (which is
                  currently dominated by TSMC and Samsung).

                  There was a question about IoT domain, where both energy and
                  cost are very sensitive topics (as they are in the mining
                  domain). The instruction set really matters in these domains.
                  This is why open architecture (RISC-V), which is not locked up
                  on x86 (for laptops) or ARM (for mobile phones), has a real
                  opportunity.

                  In another answer, David quotes New York Times that there were
                  35 hardware startups in that area (I am assuming area of
                  Berkley-Stanford), and there are some who are saying there are
                  actually 55 startups.

                  RISC-V may become a commercial force to be reckoned with (so
                  that you do not have to go to Intel/AMD/ARM/Nvidia if you have
                  some design improvements). Something that Linux did for the
                  operating systems, an Open Hardware Architecture can do to
                  processors and computers.

                  The Achilles heel in the “Golden Age” argument is that CAD
                  software is extremely expensive at the moment. It is a
                  practical obstacle for many hardware designers. Development of
                  open-source CAD software would help a lot.

                A lot of thinking, arguments and intuition about hardware that
                still prevail in the public domain are based on the last 50
                years of history where the trends like Moore’s law, Dennard
                scaling, and microminiaturisation of transistors were on-going.
                As most of these effects cease to apply, we find ourselves in
                the new world, the “Golden Age of Hardware Architecture”, which
                requires new thinking, and understanding that the improved
                architecture will now become the most important tool for
                advancements in specialised hardware.

                How does it relate to Ethereum and ProgPOW, for example? I think
                there is still a misplaced belief that it is very hard or
                impossible to beat GPUs on ProgPOW with a specialised hardware,
                based on a different architecture. Google TPU is an example
                where modifying architecture (without modifying parts like
                memory) gives 29x advantage over GPUs. GPUs as they currently
                stand, are still way too general-purpose.
