                As mentioned in the article, I chose to concentrate on one
                single user to test-drive Turbo-Geth, especially given that this
                user runs archive nodes. It will be less stressful for me and
                more productive for the project to give my time and attention to
                this, until we decide that level of quality is good enough to
                recommend it to the general public.

                Having said that, the software is open-source, so anyone can
                clone, build and run it at their leisure. If someone finds a
                bug, I would be grateful for a report. No promises at all for
                looking at other requests. Current branch (rebased just today to
                the master branch of go-ethereum):

                >. The default sync mode is “full”, which actually means archive
                mode. And this is the only mode that works. One flag that will
                help you sync faster is “trie-cache-gens”. I changed its meaning
                since “geth” (since I was too lazy to introduce a new one). You
                can specify how many nodes of trie to keep around. The
                more — the better. If you have 16 Gb, you can set it to 10000000
                (10 million), if you have 26 Gb (like I have on my test
                machines), you can set it to 20000000 (20 million). You can
                experiment, by looking at those log lines:

                In the line above, there are 2.4 million nodes in memory, and
                the process takes 8.45 Gb from the operating system.

                All RPC APIs should work, though I only tested some of them
                against geth (debug_traceTransaction, debug_getModifiedAccounts,
                debug_storageRangeAt, eth_transactionReceipt, eth_getLogs), and
                they were generally faster, except those that retrieve
                transaction receipts. This is because Turbo-Geth does not keep
                receipts in the database anymore, but recomputes them of the fly
                from the historical state by re-executing transactions in the
                block. Sometimes it is slower, but within the factor of 2. I
                will keep optimising those, of course.

              <p name="572d" id="572d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                There is a great deal of optimisation Turbo-Geth can bring in
                log (events) filtering, because it can very efficiently figure
                out when certain contract started to exist (and therefore there
                is no point in looking into the blocks prior to that). I have
                not done those one yet, and this is part of the private beta
                exercise.

                Although after the last rebase, theoretically Turbo-Geth should
                have all the code for Constantinople, it does not. There is a
                quirk in the new opcode, CREATE2, allowing the creator of the
                contract to revive the contract after it has been
                self-destructed. This is known and has been discussed by the
                core devs, so do not worry. Because of the way Turbo-Geth
                persists contract storage, it needs special handling for this,
                effectively nullifying all the storage after self-destruction.

              <p name="3bca" id="3bca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                I initially thought I would pursue some features that would
                allow more users: pruning (which is now almost trivial to
                implement), warp sync (since fast sync is too hard to support
                with the data layout).
              </p>
              <p name="d5a2" id="d5a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                However, I can see that I will get overwhelmed by this and
                further work unless I start utilising community contribution and
                opening up the development to other people. Two prerequisites to
                that are good test harnesses and good documentation.
              </p>

                Therefore, I decided that I will keep Turbo-Geth an archive-node
                only for the near future (which will still be useful for the
                early adopters), and concentrate on test harnesses. It is also a
                good time to be doing testing — Constantinopole is coming soon.
