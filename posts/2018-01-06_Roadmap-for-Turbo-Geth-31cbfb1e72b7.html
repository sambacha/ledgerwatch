                For the last few weeks (since 3rd of December 2017), I have been
                obsessed with the idea of optimising Ethereum client (in
                particular go-ethereum, but I am sure almost everything can be
                carried over to other implementations). I believe this is an
                urgent demand, and it will not go away even with introduction of
                Casper.

                Majority of optimisations are related to handling of Ethereum
                state. The main goal of optimisations is to reduce the time it
                takes for blocks to propagate through the network, which will
                allow further increase in gas limit without corresponding
                increase of the uncle rate.

                Now I feel I need to publish this, before I get deeper and
                deeper and start neglecting other aspects of my life. I need to
                publish this to get rid of that obsession.

                This is my plan. I have forked go-ethereum repository, and
                started making changes. When the changes are more-less polished,
                I will try to make into a working client. But the intent is, of
                course, to get at least some of these changes ported back into
                the go-ethereum. Now I will list the optimisations. I am
                planning to further expand the points with more details. I will
                also add preamble describing the current layout of the state in
                the go-ethereum node.

                  Reuse of stateDB object, and specifically its storage tries
                  (one per account) between the blocks. Currently, the stateDB
                  object is re-created before each new block gets processed.
                  There is a cache of the account trie, which allows new StateDB
                  object to pick up the old trie, but there is no cache of
                  storage trie. Therefore, storage tries come into processing of
                  every block cold. I have implemented this change in my version
                  in these commits:

                  Change the trie node caching from generation-based approach to
                  node-count based approach. Currently, by default 120 so-called
                  generations of the trie nodes are stored. Generation advances
                  whenever the state is committed into the database (after block
                  processing). Each node carries the generation mark, which is
                  brought in line with the current generation whenever the node
                  is touched. Nodes with generation mark smaller than “current
                  generation — 120” are evicted from the cache. The change is to
                  have generation advance every time a node gets touched. That
                  means we won’t keep certain number of generations, but instead
                  certain number of nodes. This parameter (number of nodes to
                  keep) will be much easier to calibrate than the number of
                  generations, so more memory can be given to the trie node
                  cache. I have implemented this change (with some other stuff)

                  Change the way the trie nodes are stored in the database,
                  specifically what constitutes the key. Currently, each node is
                  stored as one record in LevelDB. The key is the 32-byte hash
                  of the node, and the value is the RLP serialisation of the
                  node. Nodes can be of 3 types: full nodes (array of 17
                  elements, 16 for each nibble, and 17-th for the value), short
                  nodes (key-value pair), and value nodes (leaves of the trie).
                  Value nodes exist only theoretically, but not actually in the
                  database, because their existence requires having 2 SHA3
                  images that only differ in the last 4 bits. Practically, all
                  trie leaves are contained in short nodes. When a trie branch
                  is “cold” (not expanded), in order to reach a certain leaf or
                  sub-branch, a few levels of the trie need to be expanded (4
                  levels on average). Each expansion requires a lookup in the
                  LevelDB. The worst thing about it is that these lookups have
                  to be sequential, because the key for the deeper level is
                  contained on the level right above it. The change is to have
                  LevelDB keys not being hashes of the values, but instead based
                  on the paths from the root to the branch of leaf. The key
                  would be constructed as follows: &lt;trie
                  prefix&gt;|&lt;path&gt;|&lt;block mask&gt;. &lt;trie
                  prefix&gt; allows differentiating tries from each other. In my
                  implementation, account trie has “AT” prefix in all its keys,
                  and each storage trie has the address of the account as
                  prefix. &lt;Path&gt; is a compact representation of path from
                  the trie root to the branch or leaf. &lt;block mask&gt; is
                  bitwise-inverted value of block number in which the entry was
                  created. This trick allows finding the nodes that were added
                  prior to a certain block using LevelDB’s range queries
                  (LevelDB stores records in sorted order, so the range queries
                  are efficient). I have implemented this change, but it is
                  spread over many commits.

                  Handling of chain re-orgs. After change (3), in order to
                  support chain re-orgs, we need to be able to remove all nodes
                  belonging to the certain range of blocks, before we apply the
                  new blocks. This could be easily achieved by storing some
                  additional info in the database. Each time we store a trie
                  node, we also add a record with a key &lt;block
                  number&gt;|&lt;counter&gt; and value being the key of the
                  node. When we need to clean up, we use range query &lt;block
                  number&gt;* to find all nodes to clean up. I have not
                  implemented this change yet.

                  State reads to require only 1 database lookup. With the change
                  (3), and a small addition, where for each short node, we also
                  write out the value node separately, with the full path, we
                  can read values from the state without expanding the trie at
                  all. I have implemented this change in this

                  Pre-fetch trie expansion lookups for state modifications, in
                  parallel. Because of change (3), trie expansions are not
                  dependent on each other, and can be performed in parallel. I
                  have implemented this (spread over many commits) and currently
                  profiling and tuning it. It is currently not clear whether
                  this in fact is an improvement. It looks like LevelDB
                  serialises concurrent reads, so this could only work with a
                  different database (perhaps BoltDB or BadgerDB?)

                  cases, running them against the current state and
                  pre-expanding some areas of the tries will speed up the
                  processing of the next block, when it does come. I have not

                  it in the past and need to re-verify it for Ethereum tries)
                  that most of the trie nodes stored in memory will end up being
                  full nodes with 2 occupied and 15 non-occupied nodes. Because
                  they are stored as array of 17 elements, each element being a
                  reference (8 bytes), it ends up being 136 bytes per node. If
                  this type of node does indeed turn out to be dominant, we can
                  store it in 17 bytes (4 bits for the index of the first
                  non-empty child, 4 bit bits for the index of the second

                  More efficient storage of trie nodes in the database. I have
                  not done the analysis, but I suspect that there is quite a lot
                  of repetition in the trie nodes stored in the database. In
                  particular, certain trie nodes, once touched, but then never
                  used, will be repeatedly referenced from the sibling nodes.
                  Once I have done analysis on this, I can suggest some ways to
                  improve this.
