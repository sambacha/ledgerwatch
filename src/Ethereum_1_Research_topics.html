        >Migration from hexary to binary tries
      </h2>
      <p>
        If it is found that binary merkle tries are more beneficial than hexary
        merkle tries (and perhaps that it is also beneficial to change the hash
        function used to hash the trie), we need to think about potential
        migration path for existing implementations. Currently proposal is
        described here:
        <a
          href="https://ethresear.ch/t/optimizing-sparse-merkle-trees/3751"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://ethresear.ch/t/optimizing-sparse-merkle-trees/3751</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Theoretically, we can do a minimally disruptive migration by nominally
        keeping the patricia hex tree structure, but changing the hash function
        from
      </p>
      <pre><code>sha(rlp(x1 .... x16))
</code></pre>
      <p>to</p>
      <pre><code>merkle_tree(x1 ... x16)
</code></pre>
      <p>
        So then we would get most of the witness size reduction benefits. But at
        DB level nothing would change. Even for incremental update, we could
        make the root deterministic if we put information about whether or not
        an account was updated into the leaf.

        For decoupling merkle tree from the data storage. The result of this
        research is benchmarks and documentation on how to deal with various
        issues when changing from trie-based storage model to flat storage
        model. Examples of such issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reconstruction of trie on the fly</li>
        <li>Handling of reorgs</li>

        </li>
        <li>Snapshot sync</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This documentation should serve as a guide for any implemention team who
        wishes to migrate their implementations to the flat storage model.<br />

        Research phases:<br />
        <strong>THIN HISTORY</strong>. Indexing of historical data - we are
        researching and implementing the approach in which most of the data
        about historical changes of accounts and contract storage are kept in
        the form of “change sets” (1 change set is written per block), and the
        “history” is simply the index mapping account address hashes or storage
        slot hashes to the “timeseries” of block number where these accounts and
        storage slots have been modified. This is mostly implemented, and the
        next phase is comparative testing with the previous model, where
        “history” contained most of the data. We currently expect further
        reduction in disk space requirement for storing the history, and
        insignificant slowdown of large historical queries (due to the fact that
        data will be queried using the index, adding an extra round trip to the
        database). Results of this phase are comparative benchmarks of THIN
        HISTORY vs THICK HISTORY.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BOUNDARY HASHES</strong>. This aims to solve the biggest
        drawbacks of the current implementation of the flat data layout - slow
        startup of the node (because it has to read all the accounts and build
        the top of the Patricia Merkle tree in memory), and difficulty to become
        light server, as well as “Red Queen”/”Firehose” seeder (Red Queens and
        Firehose are snapshot sync protocols, superior to “fast sync” and “warp
        sync” that we are planning to implement). The main idea is to add an
        extra bucket to the database, recording the subset of intermediate
        hashes (as mapping prefix =&gt; node hash, which is still compatible
        with the flat layout). Instead of maintaining such intermediate hashes
        for all the intermediate nodes, the plan is to maintain them only for
        the nodes that are not current in the memory. This should reduce
        unnecessary database churn while still delivering the benefits. We
        currently expect a slight increase in the database size, as well as some
        extra database write I/O per block. We expect this to be a trade off for
        much quicker start up time, as well as unblocking further development of
        Red Queen/Firehose snapshot sync protocols. Results of this phase are
        comparative benchmarks of startup times at various block heights;
        performance of “get_Proof” RPC method for recent block heights, compared
        with go-ethereum; comparison of extra database size and write I/O with
        and without the intermediate hashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RED QUEEN</strong>. This aims to develop a snapshot sync method
        that is more efficient than fast sync (supported by most
        implementation), and more secure than warp sync. Flat data layout makes
        it impossible to efficiently support fast sync, because fast sync’s
        primitive, called GetNodeData queries trie nodes based solely on their
        hashes, which implies the existence of the index from hashes to the node
        data. This index is missing in the flat data model. Warp sync is more
        efficient, but it has two main downsides. Firstly, the warp snapshots
        need to be pre-generated before being served. Secondly, the recipient of
        a wrap can only verify the warp’s correctness after it has been
        downloaded in its entirety. Red Queen sync has first been designed to be
        a combination of a protocol and an algorithm. Protocol is a set of
        primitives that request data to be transmitted from one peer (seeder) to
        another (leecher). Algorithm is the strategy that uses primitives of the
        protocol to synchronise the current or recent state. The main idea of
        Red Queen sync algorithm is to not assume that the seeder are able to
        serve any historical views of the state, they always server what they
        deem to be the current state. It is the job of the leecher (and the Red
        Queen algorithm) to combine the data from potentially different block
        heights and eventually arrive at a consistent and complete view of the
        state.

        For aim 1, there would be a remote access to the turbo-geth database,
        whicn will allow extracting data without stopping the turbo-geth node.
        That way, stats can be gathered, and charts and tables produced and
        published automatically at regular intervals.<br />
        For aim 2, the tools used for extracting data from a working turbo-geth

        For letting most nodes in the network to use less resources to process
        blocks. The results of this research are prototypes, benchmarks,
        documentation and specification describing how to implement stateless
        processing. Implementation would include three main parts:
      </p>
      <ol>

        Stateless clients is one approach to improve performance of Ethereum
        client implementations while processing blocks of transactions.
        Specifically, it seeks to ease the increasing burden that is the state
        size. It does so by removing the need to download, or implicitely
        construct and maintain the state, for most of the participants in the
        Ethereum network. The requirement to access to the state is removed by
        introducing another type of data packets (existing data packet types
        are, for example, blocks and transactions) to be gossipped around the
        p2p network. We call this data packets “block witnesses”. For each block
        we have one corresponding block witness. The two main properties that
        block witnesses have:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It is possible to verify efficiently that the block witness is indeed
          constructed from the correct version of the Ethereum state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Block witness has all the required information to make it possible to
          execute the corresponding block.
        </li>
      </ol>

        >Research roadmap
      </h3>
      <p>
        To make stateless clients a reality and get it implemented in all
        Ethereum 1 clients, these large steps seem to be necessary, up to the
        research test-net launch:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Revisiting of the prototype</strong> (currently based on
          Turbo-Geth). Previous version of the prototype, that was used to
          produced data in the medium article showed above, had a different
          encoding for the structure than what is currently proposed (based on
          the “multiproofs” section here:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/master/docs/programmers_guide/guide.md#multiproofs"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/master/docs/programmers_guide/guide.md#multiproofs</a
          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refresh the data</strong>. Using updated prototype, produce
          new data, and add non-smoothed charts (previously published charts
          were moving average over 1024 block to make them smoother, but they
          potentially concealed some extremes)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Estimate savings in the block witness size from switching to binary
            tries</strong
          >
          It is a conjecture that switching to binary tries would reduce the
          size of the block witnesses by the factor of 3-4. Also, will
          merkle-hashing of contract byte codes reduce the size of the block
          witnesses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Witnesses for genesis sync</strong>. Estimate the potential
          benefit of using partial witnesses for speeding up sync from Genesis
          block (where sync is proceeding with minimal disk I/O).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Visualisation in the prototype</strong>. Some initial steps
          have been taken (e.g. visualisations for the presentation at the
          STARKWare sessions). This needs to be extended to provide interactive
          visualisations of state and block witnesses, to help extend the circle
          of researches and developers dealing with the stateless clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prototype to support semi-stateless</strong>. Semi-stateless
          approach described here:
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/@akhounov/the-shades-of-statefulness-in-ethereum-nodes-697b0f88cd04"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >https://medium.com/@akhounov/the-shades-of-statefulness-in-ethereum-nodes-697b0f88cd04</a
          >, but the data gathering was still hard computationally. With the
          code and data from item (4) on this roadmap (persisting partial
          witnesses), it should be much more efficient to collect and compare
          the data. The threshold would not be expressed in number of blocks for
          which the “aggregated” witness is kept by a semi-stateless client.
          Instead, the threshold would be expressed in number of state trie
          nodes kept in memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analysis of potential adversarial behavior</strong>. Using the
          prototype developed, make an assessment of how much gas would an
          adversary need to pay to inflate the size of the block witness. This
          analysis will be the input to the gas cost adjustment that introducing
          stateless client would require.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incentivisation of block witness production and relay</strong
          >. Using information gathered in the previous steps, reason about what
          incentives exist for any nodes to produce and to relay block
          witnesses, and, for example, not relay blocks without witnesses.<br />
          it is a bit circular but this is my current thinking. Block witnesses
          can actually benefit full nodes (keeping the entire state) as well as
          partial nodes. Because they can reduce their memory expenditure on
          keeping the cache for its database, and instead they can simply
          consume the witnesses. If they do want to use their memory, they can
          “dial up their statefullness and dial down the witness sizes”, and
          still benefit by not having any read I/O from the database, only write
          I/O (which is much easier to do concurrently). So, in order to
          reinforce the incentive for miners to generate witnesses and prefer
          smaller witnesses to bigger witnesses, we would mostly likely need to
          change the “default” propagation rules for blocks. Currently, blocks
          are propagated once their PoW is found to be correct. In the future,
          we might need to change it to “blocks are propagated once there is a
          valid witness for it, which can be propagated alongside the block. If
          there is no witness, do not propagate the block”. For the nodes that
          benefit from the existence of the witnesses, it should be easy to
          convince the operators to switch to the new propagation rules. Once
          this propagation rule becomes the norm, miners are having clear
          incentive to produce witnesses for their blocks, because otherwise
          their blocks simply won’t propagate or propagate slowly. Note that
          even miners themselves can benefit from witnesses - because they can
          process blocks and start mining on top of them without any database
          I/O on the critical path.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Block witness specification</strong>. Formal
          (implementation-independent) description of how block witness can be
          produced, how to encode/decode them into/from the wire packets, how to
          execute transactions on a block witness. This also covers the case or
          partial witnesses, which would simply be a concatenation of smaller
          witnesses rooted at different points in the state tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New sub-protocol specification</strong>. Specify a new,
          optional sub-protocol for gossiping block witnesses (full, partial,
          and for range of blocks) around the network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gas cost specification</strong>. Based on the analysis of the
          adversarial behaviour, specify how the transaction senders will be
          charged for the production of block witnesses. If we take 16 gas per
          byte as a baseline established in Istanbul (in EIP-2028), and we
          manage to somehow remove or minimise all intermediate hashes from the
          block witness (or just ignore them), then cost of SLOAD should be
          (32+32+32) * 16=1536 gas. First 32 is address hash of contract, second
          32 is key hash of the storage item, and the third 32 is the value. If
          we apply the same crude logic to contract codes, we should charge 24 *
          1024 * 16 = 393216 gas for CALL. 24 * 1024 is the current limit on
          contract code. If we, however, figure out from the data that it would
          be beneficial to split contract code in pieces, and merklize them
          (item 2 in this roadmap), then obviously we would only need to charge
          gas whenever the instructions from a piece are actually “loaded” into
          EVM. But if the CALL instruction charge proportional to the contract
          code’s size, it would be better. This, however, still requires
          something like UNGAS, otherwise there will be quite a lot of broken
          contracts and other concerns about backwards incompatibility. This
          would encourage people to split their large contracts into smaller
          pieces, working via DELEGATECALL proxy
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Research test-net</strong>. Construct a test-net supporting
          the block witnesses. Specification from previous steps would allow any
          client implementation to catch up and join.

      </h2>
      <p>
        The aim of this project is to achieve less painful (or ideally painless)
        repricing of opcodes. We expect these repricings to be necessary to keep
        the gas costs balanced, as well as for the implementation of the State
        Ethereum project. This project only has a research roadmap at the
        moment, and the dates are very uncertain. It also has a few branches
        (alternative proposals), covering either the main mechanism with which
        backwards-compatible repricing is achieved, or some secondary issues.
        Currently, there are 2 alternative proposals for the main mechanism:
      </p>

          rel="noopener"
          >https://ep.corepaper.org/compatibility/legacy-repricing/</a
        >. The main idea is to introduce account versioning, but with the goal
        of only ever having two versions, “legacy” and “forward compatible”.
        Legacy version experiences no repricing, but its usage gets disentivised
        economically, but making it progressively more expensive than the
        forward compatible version. In the forwards compatible version, the main
        innovation is making the gas unobservable from the smart contracts
        (codename UNGAS). It is currently believed that this can be achieved by
        making 3 changes to the semantics of opcodes. Since the gas is now
        unobservable, any repricing does not affect the logic of the contracts’
        execution, only the total required gas (which can be easily changed when
        creating a transaction). In order to economically disentivise the usage
        of the legacy version, repricings are performed not by increasing the
        gas expenditure of select operations, but rather by proportionally
        decreasing the gas expenditure for all the rest of the operations. It is
        believed that it will be difficult for miners to distinguish between
        transactions only containing legacy code, forward compatible code, or
        the mixture, so they won’t be able to apply different gas prices
        accordingly, and the legacy code will become largely more expensive to
        execute. When decreasing the gas expenditure of some operations, we will
        face the fact that some of them are already quite small (3 gas, for
        example). There are currently two proposed ways of dealing with this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Changing the semantics of entering a call frame, CALL, CREATE (and
          similar) instructions to scale the remaining gas up and down by a
          certain factor
        </li>
        <li>
          Particle gas cost, introducing the units of “milligas”, or even
          perhaps “microgas”:

        >Formal system to specify semantics of Ethereum state transition
      </h2>
      <p>
        The aim of this project is to agree on the most suitable way to specify
        semantics and use it to propose changes in Ethereum more formally. It
        can also mean that such suitable semantics has to be created. Some of
        the very ambitious projects (like Project “Gas repricing vs backwards
        compatibility”) that involve very significant changes to the EVM, would
        be hard to deliver successfully without the ability to specify the
        changes in an unambiguous way. From our previous experience, the real
        scrutiny of such proposals usually starts relatively late in the
        process, once the code is written. This is because the specification
        given in prose within the EIPs is not rigorous and formal enough for the
        proper analysis to start (and, more importantly, for using automated
        analysis tools like model checkers, symbolic execution engines, etc.).
        There exist at least one known formal semantics for EVM already, called
        KEVM. It is also part of the jello paper:
        <a href="https://jellopaper.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >https://jellopaper.org/</a
        >. This semantics is complete and executable. However, its major
        drawback that the language it uses (K) is quite complex and inaccessible
        even for most core developers. Also, the process of installation of all
        required software to execute semantics makes the barrier to entry higher
        still. So far, KEVM has not been used to formalise EVM change proposals
        ahead of the implementation. Our assumption is that this is a usability
        issue. If there were an alternative semantics that uses simpler
        languages (like the one used in Web Assembly), there are much better
        chances for it to be adopted as a de-facto specification language for
        EVM changes.<br />
        In this project, we will attempt to construct a new formal semantics for
        EVM, based on a single type of substitution rules. Every rule will have
        3 elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pattern</li>
        <li>Result of the substitution</li>
        <li>Guard expression</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The matching that the pattern performs is done against the sequence of
        objects that represents the current state of EVM (also known as
        “configuration”). Like in Web Assembly specification, we treat items on
        the EVM stack and EVM instructions as the same type of objects, so that
        for most operations, opcode and operands can be matched by a simple
        mattern without the use of extraction functions.<br />
        This project has both research and implementation roadmaps, but they are
        closely intertwined and are likely to proceed in a lock-step fashion.
        That is why we combine them in one list for the time being. At any point
        of the roadmap we may encounter unsolvable problems, and the project may
        need to be abandoned or rescoped. That is why the roadmap attempts to
        probe more difficult areas of EVM functionality first, because they are
        more likely to be unsolvable.

        >Previous write up of ideas
      </h3>
      <p>
        Current idea is to use the notation similar to what<br />
        is used in Web Assembly, which is very clever system, and is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          State of the system, of configuration, is described as a tuple of
          functions (for accounts, storage etc.), and an instruction sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interestingly, the stack does not have a separate representation and
          is instead represented as a part of the instruction sequence. To
          achieve that, a special <code>const</code> instruction carrying a
          value is used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most operations will be represented as a reduction rule that involve
          pattern that has to be matched inside the sequence of instruction, and
          an optional guard, which is formulated as a logical formula. Guards
          let us choose between multiple rules applicable to the same
          configuration, and allows us computing the effect of the operation on
          parts of the state.
        </li>
        <li>
          For our purposes, we can try to represent a gas counter (or two) a
          part of the instruction sequence too (with special instruction
          <code>gas_counter</code>, so we can have different reduction rules
          that apply depending on whether there is sufficient gas, as well as
          properly decrease the counter on usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Things like execution frames are trickier. We need an ability to scrap
          them completely when the frame is aborted or we perform
          <code>RETURN</code>. For that reason we might need to introduce frame
          boundary “instructions”, <code>frame_begin</code>,
          <code>frame_id_1</code> … , <code>frame_begin</code>,
          <code>frame_id_2</code> …, <code>frame_end</code>,
          <code>frame_id_2</code>, …, <code>frame_end</code>,
          <code>frame_id_1</code>. In this way, pattern matching can recognise
          where frames begin and end so they can be eliminated. Frame ids are
          required to ensure that any reduction rule that removes the entire
          frame can specify in the guard that frame id at the start of the frame
          matches the frame id at the end of the frame. And, the frame needs to
          have its own frame id present locally.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        One of the challenges is how to model the sub-states. Complexity with
        the substates is that the state modifications made in an execution frame
        (substate) could be reverted or “committed” at the end of the frame.
        However, the opcodes are allowed to reach beyond the substate and that
        can potentially trigger cascading reads.<br />
        To solve this, we can employ certain level of non-determinism. When the
        instructions like <code>CALL</code> executes, and spawns a new frame
        between instruction sequence and the stack, it is also allowed to copy
        an arbitrary part of the enclosing frame’s state into its local
        <code>readset</code>. When the execution proceeds, reading from beyond
        the <code>readset</code> results in the failure of evaluation. However,
        with sufficiently correct <code>readset</code> the evaluation will
        proceed as required. This is where non-determinism is. Symbolic
        execution engines will be able to deal with it pretty easily by actually
        implementing cascading reads, but modelling cascading reads as a
        reduction rule would require some advanced higher-level functions.<br />
        Developing this idea, we would also have local <code>writeset</code>,
        which is getting populated during the frame’s execution, and then either
        gets merged into the encompassing frame’s <code>writeset</code>, or
        discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        When jumping instructions are executed, this leads to the replacement of
        the entire code in the current frame with the slice starting from the
        jump location.
      </p>
      <p>In preamble, the following types would need to be defined:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Integer (up to 2^256)</li>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <li>Mapping</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        List will need a “drop” operation defined, like<br />
        <code>l[index:]</code>, which is part of <code>l</code> with
        <code>index</code> number of items in the front dropped, or
        <code>invalid_list</code> if there aren’t enough items. It will be used
        for modelling jump instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mapping type will need a boolean function “submap” that tells if one
        mapping is a sub-mapping of another <code>m1&lt;=m2</code>. It will be
        used to check that the <code>readset</code> (non-deterministic) of the
        newly spawned frame is correct. Also, mappings should allow “holes”,
        i.e. values that are intented to be deleted. Using them, we can define
        “merge”, which applies <code>writeset</code> generated by an execution
        frame to the <code>writeset</code> of the enclosing frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general composition of the string that is getting reduced during the
        execution is this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>(1 stack1 [configuration1] instructions1 )1
</code></pre>
      <p>
        When instruction <code>CALL</code> (or similar) is encountered,<br />
        it spawns another exection frame within the first one:
      </p>
      <pre><code>(1 stack1 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 [configuration1] CALL instructions1 )1
=&gt;
(1 stack1 [configuration1 - gas]
   (2 stack2-empty [configuration2 + readset]
   instructions of the called contract
   )2
instructions1 )1
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Until this new execution frame completes, it will prevent any reduction
        rules in the first frame to proceed, because most reduction rules will
        have this kind of left hand side:
      </p>
      <pre><code>operand1 operand2 .. operand_n [configuration] OPCODE
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Some reduction rules will include frame boundaries like
        <code>(1</code> and <code>)1</code> and some wildcards (* - matching any
        number of objects). Note that <code>(1</code> will need to be two
        separate objects, so that we can have a guard to make sure that the
        frame id that we are matching corresponds to the inner-most frame. For
        example, revert will be something like this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>[configuration]( frame_id * mem_start mem_end [frame_id, mem] REVERT * frame_id )
==&gt;
[configuration'],
if
configuration' = configuration + mem[mem_start:mem_end]
</code></pre>
      <p>It is not very formal yet, but just to give an idea.</p>
      <p>The next two challenges are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gas charge for memory expansion</li>
        <li>Limitation of the stack depth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Memory of an execution frame is modelled as a list of bytes + an integer
        specifying the starting address of the memory. Ending address can be
        always computed as starting address + length of the list. When memory is
        expanded, we need might need multiple guards for the cases where it is
        expanded upwards or downwards, with overlapping and non-overlapping
        “allocation”. When the memory is read onto the stack and writting from
        the stack, we need to have functions defined that turn certain number of
        bytes into the 0…2^256-1 integer.<br />
        In order to support the limitation of the stack depth (1024), there
        needs to be a short notation for matching large number of objects, so we
        do something like this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>( frame_id *{1024} [frame_id] PUSH1 x * ) frame_id ==&gt;
OutOfStackDepthException
</code></pre>
      <p>
        In the above, the entire execution frame gets remove by the reduction
        rule. Unfortunately, there is nowhere to put the exception, but it can
        still be part of the configuration for the purposes of semantics and
        symbolic execution tools.

        Model for what state syncronisation is, describe existing and proposed

        fast sync, beam sync, firehose etc., illuminate their differences and

        or Cloudflare. There are preliminary results indicating that it is
        possible to partition the Ethereum state in fragments in such a way that
        there is not too much churn (i.e. number of fragments updating per block
        is not very high). What are these partitioning techniques? Which
        external systems to use?<br />

      </h2>
      <p>
        This project aims at developing techniques to address two main
        challenges arising when the sizes of the transactions travelling over
        the network, increase:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When Ethereum nodes restart, they need to reconcile their transaction
          pool with their peers. Currently reconciliation is done by simply
          downloading all the transactions from a peer. When transactions gets
          larger, this method will require more bandwidth and time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of the transaction pool implementations attempt to limit the
          amount of memory the utilise. For mining nodes, it is also important
          to be able to efficiently execute strategies for inclusion of
          transaction into a newly mined block. Larger transactions mean that
          more sophisticated data structures need to be employed to find a good
          tradeoff between memory consumption and strategic efficiency for
          miners.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A more straightforward solution that is currently pursued by a couple of
        implementation (go-ethereum and Trinity) is to use transaction hashes
        (32 bytes) as transaction IDs. Then, the transaction bodies would be
        persisted by the nodes. They would reconcile their transaction sets
        using transaction IDs, rather than the entire bodies.<br />
        Another, more opportunistic solution, could be the use of the minisketch
        library:
        <a
          href="https://github.com/sipa/minisketch"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://github.com/sipa/minisketch</a
        ><br />
        The capacity of the sketch, C is the maximum number of differences that
        the sketch can reconcile. And the size of the sketch is B * C bits,
        where B - size of each element (in our case B would be 256 for Tx hash).
        so, if you only expect up to 1024 differences, and you use 256 bits of
        the Tx hash for reconciliation, your sketch sizes would be 256Kb.<br />
        The roadmaps for this project are currently unknown, but may be provided
        at a later date.

        >Chain pruning
      </h2>
      <p>
        This project aims at looking at techniques that would be required to
        deal with every growing size of the blockchain, in terms of block
        headers, block bodies, and transaction receipts. Unlike the State, these
        data are almost append-only (the only time they get rewritten are
        reorganisations of the chain, they are relatively rare).<br />
        The chain of block headers grows the slowest (in terms of its size), but
        it is necessary to download even for the light clients. There are two
        potential solutions to that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Regular checkpointing. Once in a while, let’s say once a year, a new
          checkpoint hash is publicly agreed and hard-coded into the Ethereum
          implementation code. That way, light clients and others do no need to
          download all the headers.
        </li>
        <li>
          There could be a potential to generate the compact proof of header
          chain ancestry. It would allow to not download the entire chain of
          headers and verify PoW on every single header, but instead use proof
          systems like SNARK or STARK to have a compact proof that a certain
          header is correct in the sense that it has ancestry all the way to the
          genesis block (or some other “checkpoint” block), with all PoW correct
          along the way.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The sequence of block bodies grows fast, and it is expected to grow even
        faster after the “Instanbul” upgrade, lowering the cost of inclusion
        data into a block from 68 gas per byte to 16 gas per byte.<br />
        The sequence of receipts grows the fastest, but most users don’t require
        the entire sequence. Also, any receipt can be regenerated by
        re-executing the corresponding transaction in the context of the
        historical state. The history of state tends to be more compact to store
        than receipts, though re-generation of a receipt tends to be 10 times
        slower than simply fetching it from the database (data from tests on
        turbo-geth from September 2018).<br />

          shared library
